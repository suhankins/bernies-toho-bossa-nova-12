                    This is an unoffical website for Toho Bossa Nova 12 album.
                    Made by Punished Bernadetta. I don't have rights to any of
                    the images or any of the text on this website. I just wanted
                    to make this website, because I'm a big fan of Toho Bossa
                    Nova albums and it makes me a bit sad that their websites
                    look like they were made in the 90s. I hope you liked the
                    way this website looks! I tried to keep it close to
                    original, while making it look slightly more modern (like
                    early 2010s instead of late 90s).
